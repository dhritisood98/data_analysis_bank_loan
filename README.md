This repository contains the analysis and predictive modeling for a case study on Loan Default Prediction and Investment Strategies using data from LendingClub, a leading peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platform. The goal of this project is to develop predictive models that can help investors assess the risk of loan defaults and identify the best loans to invest in for maximizing returns.

**Project Overview**
Lending Club issues personal loans with different risk levels, assigned by a loan grade (A to G), and loans are either "fully paid" or "charged off" (defaulted). Using historical loan data from 2013-2015, we aim to:

**Predict loan defaults:** Identify loans likely to default based on borrower and loan attributes.

**Investment strategies:** Create models to help investors choose loans with the best returns while minimizing the risk of defaults.

I performed a comprehensive data exploration and build various predictive models (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forest, Boosted Trees) to classify loans as ‘fully paid’ or ‘charged off.’ The models' performance is evaluated using confusion matrices, ROC curves, and profit-loss calculations.
